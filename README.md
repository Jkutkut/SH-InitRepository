# Sh_InitRepository

This simple sh code enable us to link an empty repository on github to a local repository. This local repository will be generated by this shell script, creating a basic README.md file. 

# How to:
- Execute the file as a normal sh file to use the default parameters (Initial values of the variables).
- Use *--help* to see all the features of the script.
